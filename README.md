My name is Natalia, and I am at the beginning of my career as a data scientist. For the last few years I have been working as a sound engineer on TV in a post-production studio. I decided to start something new for me and graduated from Yandex.A workshop, a course on data science.

I am a beginner Python and SQL programmer, familiar with Jupiter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn libraries

I speak Russian, English and study Spanish. I am interested in music and climbing and I continue to work in sound engineering.

At the moment I am looking for opportunities to improve my skills. Please contact me with any suggestions.
